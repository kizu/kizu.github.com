# Articles and Experiments by Roman Komarov

## Hello!

I’m working as a Front-end Web Developer at [Oyst](http://www.oyst.com) (before that — at a similar position at [Yandex](http://yandex.com)), occasionally doing different stuff for Russian [“Web Standards”](http://web-standards.ru/about/en/) community, committing to open source projects, experimenting on CSS, and blogging on this site.


### The latest publications

See also [the whole list of publications](everything/).


### Projects

I created [Hayaku](http://hayakubundle.com), [Jekiller](gh:shower/jekyller), and [Bemto](gh:kizu/bemto); I'm a maintainer of [Stylus](gh:stylus/stylus), and sometimes committing in different ways to other open source projects.


### Talks

Sometimes I talk about different front-end stuff at conferences, mostly Russian ones, but I managed to [give a talk](http://vimeo.com/51897358) at [Fronteers Jam Session in 2012](http://fronteers.nl/congres/2012/jam-session), and then [another one in 2013](https://fronteers.nl/congres/2013/jam-session/dont-look-into-the-source) at the same place.


### How to contact me

The best way to contact me is to write me a letter to my e-mail address — [kizmarh@ya.ru](mailto:kizmarh@ya.ru).

I participate in different social networks, but there is no point to list them there. The chances are — _I do not want to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn_, but if you'd go and [look at all the cats in my Instagram](https://instagram.com/ki_zu) — I'll be happy.
