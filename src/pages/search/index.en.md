# Search

I have implemented[^post] a search form for my site, here it is[^js-only]:

{{<Sidenotes span="4">}}
  [^post]: I have also wrote a [post about it]({{% LinkTo algolia-search %}}) with some implementation details.

  [^js-only]: Note that this search form is JS-based, so without JavaScript enabled it won't work.
{{</Sidenotes>}}

{{% Search %}}

You could also find this search form on other pages it would be almost always hidden behind a “🔎” button inside a header and a footer.
