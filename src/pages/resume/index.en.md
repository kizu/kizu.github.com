# Résumé

## Summary

I am a **Front-End Web Developer** with 10 years of professional experience, researching and implementing highly performant, scalable and maintainable CSS practices for large websites and web-applications, as well as standards-compliant, semantic and accessible HTML, and JavaScript for complex UI behaviors.


## Objective

I'm looking for a place where I could apply my CSS skills. I can solve any possible CSS issue: from vertical centering to project's architecture, but the more complex problems you can provide, the happier I would be dealing with them. One day I dream to work on CSS itself by contributing to specifications, so there is that.

I'm currently located in Russia, and I'm looking for opportunities to relocate to somewhere else (Canada, Europe, USA, New Zealand and so on).
