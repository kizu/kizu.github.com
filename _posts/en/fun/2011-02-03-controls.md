# Custom CSS3 controls

[demo:controls]

This experiment features the heavy-css-styled radio-buttons, made without any use of JS using the `:checked` pseudo-class. And with somewhat graceful degradation for some old browsers.

Also, there is some strange non-semantic structure, in which I tried to overcome one old [webkit’s bug](http://css-tricks.com/8439-webkit-sibling-bug/). Since there is a better solution for this problem (using the always-runnng animation), this experiment was useful to me ’cause, you know, it’s always fun to overcome a bug and create something that works as intended. In the further experiments I'd use the animation bug-fix.

I have a lot of other thoughts for custom inputs, so stay tuned!
